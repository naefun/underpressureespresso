about us:

Under Pressure Espresso is an Independent coffee shop in Sutton Coldfield. Striving to serve up some of the best 
coffee in the country and to promote knowledge in the cafe about every stage of the coffee cycle, from seed to cup 
(if you're interested).

As Sutton Coldfields only real "speciality" coffee shop, we really hope that you stop by and try what we have to offer. 
We're a little different from anything else going on in Sutton town at the moment. We are fully focused on serving up 
coffee to the absolute best of our abilities. Coffee that has been sourced from some of the most amazing farms around 
the world and roasted impeccably. We're here to showcase all of that hard work in the cup. We can't wait serve you and 
see what you think.

"Striving to serve up some of the best coffee in the country" has become our little motto, but it's not only true for 
coffee, it goes for everything that we do. 
The only way that this is really consistently a possibility with coffee, is by using one of the best coffee roasters in 
the world. 
And so, let me introduce you to Morgon Coffee Roasters, from Gothenburg, Sweden.
